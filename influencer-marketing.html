      textarea_html: <p>Great question! Over to Candy first for a brief introduction. "Lol. That's something I ask myself every morning. A part from being outgoing and good in front of the camera, I am also a master sales person. I can sell ice to a penguin! With 3 million followers, this fierce skill of mine is an investment for all brands I work with, and myself - of course."</p><p>Anything else? "Yup, I have a Bachelor Degree in Brand Communications, I'm Copywriting and storytelling specialist annnnd this gal has 8 years experience in social media growth. But that's not all. I also have 8 years experience working in international markets - something that not too many South Africans can say."</p>

      textarea_html: <p>Thanks, Candy. Jonty, you're up. Tell us a bit about you. "Well, when words can't describe a setting, I let my camera do the work." Sounds like you're the photographer here? "Correct. I have a wealth of experience in creating beautiful imagery for brands, hotels and the tourism industry - I capture unique selling points that drive sales and repeat customers. The funny thing is that I actually have a Bachelor Degree in Environmental Management, but shortly after university, I became a photographer and videographer. I'm also a strategist and collaboration specialist with 8 years experience in social media growth and 8 years experience working in international markets</p>
