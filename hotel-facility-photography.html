          <p>Candy and Jonty took my website to another level</p><p>I turned my
          hobby into a business which meant I needed to upgrade my website. In
          search of doing so, I found The Kings and decided to have them build
          me a custom-made website because I wanted my website to stick out from
          all the rest of the websites.</p><p>I gave them an idea of what I
          wanted and they created a website more than I could have envisioned
          (and may I add that they did so in so little time). I'm absolutely in
          love with the results.</p><p>Besides being so professional, Jonty and
          Candy are very kind, and patient, and are continuously available to
          answer any question I have even after the website handover.</p>
