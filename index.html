      <h2>about us</h2><h4>We're hotel photographers with 3 Million
      followers!</h4><p>What does that even mean for you, oh sweet hotel GM? It
      means you're not just getting content that takes your socials from "nice
      pic" to "I want to book this room", but you're also getting raved about to
      our 3 million followers.</p><p>Still not quite sure what that means? Ok,
      let us explain it like this... How much will is cost you to put your TV
      commercial in front of 3 million travel-hungry people who can afford your
      hotel rooms? Probably a couple $10,000s (maybe even a few $100,000s).
      Well, we can reach that audience for not even a 1/4 of that
      price.</p><p>Bet you're understanding now, huh.</p><p>So, if you're the
      kind of guy (or gal) that likes to release 2 birds with one hand (and by
      that we mean get "I want to book this room" kinda content and have your
      brand put in front of 3 million people), then go ahead and <a
